# aws-s3-baseline

A micro-baseline to check for insecure or public S3 buckets and bucket objects in your AWS Environment. This [InSpec](https://github.com/chef/inspec) compliance profile verifies that you do not have any insure or open to public S3 Bucket or Bucket Objects in your AWS Environment in an automated way.

### Required Gems:

This profile requires the following gems:

  - `inspec`
  - `inspec-bin`
  - `aws-sdk-s3`
  - `concurrent-ruby`

#### Warning: Large amounts of Bucket Objects

The `s3-objects-no-public-access` control iterates through and verifies every objects in each bucket in your AWS Environment, thus its runtime will depend on the number of objects in your S3 Buckets.

On average the profile can process around 500 - 1000 objects/sec.

If you have buckets with large numbers of objects, we suggest you script a loop and use the `single_bucket` input to parallelize the workload.

To see the processing in more details use the `-l debug` flag to get verbose output.

Then you can load all your HDF JSON results into [Heimdall Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org) to easily review all your scan results.

## Getting Started

It is intended and recommended that InSpec and this profile be run from a **"runner"** host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over **AWS CLI**.

**For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.**

The latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

This baseline also requires the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) which is available at the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) site.

### Getting MFA Aware AWS Access, Secret and Session Tokens

You will need to ensure your AWS CLI environment has the right system environment variables set with your AWS region and credentials and session token to use the AWS CLI and InSpec resources in the AWS environment. InSpec supports the following standard AWS variables:

- `AWS_REGION`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional) - required if MFA is enabled

### Notes on MFA

In any AWS MFA enabled environment - you need to use `derived credentials` to use the CLI. Your default `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` will not satisfy the MFA Policies in AWS environments.

- The AWS documentation is here: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-session-token.html>
- The AWS profile documentation is here: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html>
- A useful bash script for automating this is here: <https://gist.github.com/dinvlad/d1bc0a45419abc277eb86f2d1ce70625>

To generate credentials using an AWS Profile you will need to use the following AWS CLI commands.

a. `aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn:aws:iam::<$YOUR-MFA-SERIAL> --token-code <$YOUR-CURRENT-MFA-TOKEN> --profile=<$YOUR-AWS-PROFILE>`

b. Then export the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` that was generated by the above command.

## Tailoring to Your Environment

The following inputs must be configured in an inputs ".yml" file for the profile to run correctly for your specific environment. More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).

```yaml
# List of buckets exempted from inspection.
exception_bucket_list:
  - bucket1
  - bucket2
  ...

# Test only one bucket
single_bucket: 'my-bucket'
```

## Note

When you use the `single_bucket` input, the profile will _***ONLY scan***_ that bucket.

# Usage

```
# Set required ENV variables
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key-id
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=access-key
$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=session-token # if MFA is enabled
```

## Running This Baseline Directly from Github

### Testing all your buckets except those defined in your `excluded buckets`

`inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/aws-s3-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --target aws:// --input-file=your_inputs_file.yml --reporter=cli json:your_output_file.json`

### Testing a single bucket

`inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/aws-s3-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --target aws:// --input single_bucket=your_bucket --reporter=cli json:your_output_file.json`

### Different Run Options

[Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)

## Running This Baseline from a local Archive copy

If your runner is not always expected to have direct access to GitHub, use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this baseline and all of its dependent tests:

(Git is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site.)

When the **"runner"** host uses this profile baseline for the first time, follow these steps:

### Create your Archieve of the Profile

```bash
mkdir profiles
cd profiles
git clone https://github.com/mitre/aws-s3-baseline
inspec archive aws-s3-baseline
```

### Run your scan using the Archieved Copy

`inspec exec <name of generated archive> --target aws:// --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>`

### Updating your Archieved Copy

For every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this baseline:

```bash
cd aws-s3-baseline
git pull
cd ..
inspec archive aws-s3-baseline --overwrite
```

### Run your updated Archieved Copy

`inspec exec <name of generated archive> --target aws:// --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>`

## Using Heimdall for Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into **[heimdall-lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)** for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results.

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a **[full heimdall server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall)**, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
